     <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Colorectal cancer is the second-largest cause of cancer-related death. While the primary tumor is relatively easy to remove surgically, metastases present dangerous complications. The major hurdles in treating the secondary tumors are locating them, eliminating only the aberrant cells, and reducing the negative treatment side-effects. Thus our iGEM Team at FAU Erlangen will create a bispecific antibody as a targeting marker, enabling T-lymphocytes to target colorectal cancer cells. Our protein is designed as a Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE)  as novel pathway for T-lymphocytes, a component of the body’s immune system to actively attack cancer cells. The challenge being to test several different approaches for producing bispecific antibodies in <i>E. coli</i> regarding the production efficacy, the ease of the procedure, and the stability and binding affinity of the product. We hereby strive to gain new insights that will prove beneficial in streamlining the production process of bispecific antibodies and reducing production costs.</p>

      <button class="accordion">The Current State of Antibody Therapy</button>
        <div class="panel bg-light">
          <p>Since the application of bispecific antibodies is a relatively new approach, current protocols for production are not yet standardized. In the majority of cases mammalian cells are used for the expression of these proteins. However, this expression system is associated with very high costs and proves to be very time-consuming. An alternative presents itself in the use of the bacterial host <i>Escherichia coli</i> for the expression of recombinant protein. It is well published and provides many advantages over the expression in mammalian cells, such as far cheaper cultivation, a higher proliferation rate, and faster protein production. In spite of these benefits, producing proteins of mammalian origin in <i>E. coli</i> can prove to be difficult, since post-translational modifications are often vital to protein folding and function and cannot be replicated in these bacterial hosts. Especially for complex proteins like antibodies, misfolding is often detrimental for their solubility and performance. <br>
          Devising a reliable and well applicable procedure to successfully express a functional bispecific antibody in bacterial cells is detrimental in fully accessing their therapeutic potential by facilitating cost- and time-effective research. However, published protocols vary immensely and offer no conclusive approach to producing recombinant, bispecific antibodies in bacteria.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Our Approach</button>
        <div class="panel bg-light">
          <p>For our experiments we chose to create a bispecific antibody against CD3 on T-lymphocytes and gpA33. GpA33 can be found on 95% of all colorectal cancer cells and thus allows them to be specifically targeted. By also binding CD3, the bispecific antibody can activate T-lymphocytes and bring them into direct contact with the cancer cells. Our protein is designed as a Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE) and consists of two distinct single-chain variable Fragments (scFv) that are connected via a flexible linker.<br>
           We will use a pET27b plasmid with a T7 promoter and lacZ control in the <i>E. coli</i> strain Arctic Express. This strain is engineered to tolerate a high level of protein expression and shows improved protein folding capacity. It is well published that periplasmic expression of recombinant protein offers an oxidizing environment that is beneficial for correct protein folding, as well as a reduced amount of proteases that may degrade our protein. For this reason, we plan to use a PelB leader sequence to transport our constructs to the periplasm of <i>E. coli</i> for synthesis.<br>
           In our first approach, we plan to express a complete BiTE molecule that will serve as reference for our other production strategies.<br>
           In our second approach, we express the two scFv separately as fusion proteins with SpyTag or SpyCatcher, respectively. This system relies on a split domain of the FbaB protein from Streptococcus pyogenes to form a covalent, isopeptide bond upon co-culturing. This allows us to avoid the possible problem of producing a large, complex protein that could result in the formation of insoluble aggregates. Furthermore, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system is fashioned after a modular concept. If this approach proves to be successful, it will be possible to express several effector subunits with varying affinity or function, i.e. different antigen specificities or enzymatic activity, and connect them. This will allow for a flexible modular system that can be adapted with regards to current requirements in a fast and easy manner. <br>
           In our last approach, we intend to produce CD3- and gpA33-specific antibody fragments, so called Fabs, and link them together via disulfide bonds. This chemical conjugation is achieved by using a bis-dibromomaleimide cross-linker, providing a versatile method for the production of bispecific antibodies.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Proof of Concept</button>
        <div class="panel bg-light">
          <p>To test the binding affinity of our products, we will perform killing assays with blood-derived T cells. We will further test their stability in different temperatures and pH conditions. By programming a neuronal network, it will also be possible to predict possible allergenicity of our bispecific antibodies. This will also prove beneficial as a prognostic tool for the production of other recombinant proteins and their possible clinical application. Altogether, the assays will provide a comparative evaluation of the properties of our different products and permit the assessment of their respective value for clinical or scientific application.</p>

        <button class="accordion">What Makes our Team Unique? </button>
          <div class="panel bg-light">
            <p>We are a team that is tackling problems of the emerging field of molecular immunology -no team in Erlangen has done this so far. We have an optimal professional network here in Erlangen, as a new Masters-Program has been opened to sustain the ongoing research in this field, from which we can benefit greatly. Furthermore our Team has an interdisciplinary approach as we have sub-teams working on chemical ligation of Fab-Fragments and a deep-learning approach to predicting immune reactions concerning different allergens. Our interdisciplinary approach is comprehensive as it covers the cure as well as the side effects by predicting these with our neural network software.</p>
